📌 Project Overview

This task focuses on geospatial analysis to understand the geographical distribution of restaurants. Using latitude and longitude data, restaurants are visualized on maps to identify spatial patterns, regional concentration, and possible relationships between location and restaurant ratings.

🎯 Objectives

To visualize restaurant locations using geographic coordinates

To analyze restaurant distribution across cities and countries

To examine the relationship between location and restaurant ratings

🛠️ Tasks Performed
